And there goes the Big Bad Beautiful Bill, the fiscal equivalent of taking a joy ride in a Lamborghini without even bothering to have a driver's license. Higher debt and higher interest rates - is this the new American dream we're selling, folks? 🎥 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JEjQG4-tpU&pp=ygUBMQ%3D%3D

Let's be real. This bill isn't just lofty promises or a green utopia. It's a bundle of IOUs we're recklessly tossing to the next generation. 'Your future for our present' - now there’s a slogan.

Oh and let's not forget the cherry on top. As bond buyers wake up to our fiscal irresponsibility, they'll demand higher interest rates. So, we’ll get to pay more for past mistakes while piling on new ones. Talk about a double whammy!

In the end, the Big Beautiful Bill is nothing but an ugly debt monster in a pretty disguise. So while the Left whistles happily down the road to bankruptcy, remember - someone has to foot this bill. Spoiler: it ain’t gonna be them.
