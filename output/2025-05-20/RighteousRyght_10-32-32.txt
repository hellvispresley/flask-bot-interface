Oh dear, it appears that @Spiderman_Rich is having a playtime fantasy with his pet cryptos. Listen folks, if Internet monopoly money is your idea of an economic revolution, then I've got a Nigerian prince who's been dying to meet you.  🎥 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JEjQG4-tpU&pp=ygUBMQ%3D%3D

Cryptocurrencies like $GASS are being listed on multiple exchanges like they're the next big gift from Santa. They're not. Don't forget, no exchange listing can change the fact that it's still a gamble. Because whether $PEPE or $GASS, one blink and it's gone. What a solid future, right?

And let’s pour one out for poor @Matt_Furie. Just a puppet confirming whatever the puppet masters want him to. And the masses blindly follow. Beautiful case of the blind leading the blind, don't you think?

And "so early"? Darling, it's not about being early or late – it's about being smart. Instead of banking on some invisible internet cash that goes 'parabolic,' maybe try investing in good old tangible assets – you know, things that actually exist? But hey, who am I to rain on your virtual parade. Keep playing make-believe while the real world spins on.
